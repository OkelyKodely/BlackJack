To run TwentyOne.exe, you need .NET 4.0 Framework (Client Profile/Full Framework) to be installed, which can be downloaded (it is the Client Profile one) from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=24872
Also required is XNA 4.0 Redistributable and must be installed as well.  I have included it, xnafx40_redist.msi, along with the other files that are in here with this document Readme.txt.  Run that installation program as well.  These two installations are the only installs required to get up to speed.
The last step to get TwentyOne.exe to run: Make a folder named 'Content' and place it next to TwentyOne.exe with all the other files left untouched, and place all of the .xnb files that are in here into the newly made 'Content' folder.  After this last step you can play~  Double click TwentyOne.exe is all that you need to do to play and is simply it.
